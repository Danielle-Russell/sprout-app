### Summary

Sprout is an interactive fullstack application that allows users to track the daily activities and overall progress of each of their children. Designed with high maintenance babies in mind, Sprout incorporates features that make it useful for children of all ages. Users must make an account to save their information, however there is also an option for users to demo the application in its full capacity without saving any of the information they entered. Users can make individual profiles for each of their children, with a custom profile picture for each. Once entered into a profile, each child will have their own custom dashboard that outlines their growth patterns, links to each category (Growth, Activity Log, Milestones, and Health Records) where new logs can be added as well as a comprehensive list of all previously added logs. The milestone component also features a gallery for users to view images that they added upon entry with tags that explain which milestone is being referenced. Below on the dashboards, users can also view their three most recent activities logged as well as a doughnut chart, showing the average daily distribution of activities (for example, a child may eat 5 times a day but only sleep 3, while having 5 diaper changes. 

### Technology

The front-end of this application was built using React.js. The back end was built using Node.js with Express. I used React Router for my routing and a Chart.js plugin to generate my charts.
